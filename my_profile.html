    <h1>The Life of Billy</h1>

    <h2>A Quick Bio</h2>
    <p>Hey there, I'm Billy. I was born in Dominican Republic and grew up in
      Bergen County, NJ. I'm fascinated with computer science, music, and food.
      I ran XC/track, I rarely sleep, and I've watched every single season of
      Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I wrote this on my prom day hence my dressed
      up Android. I start MIT in the fall and hope to pursue CS with some
      business on the side. Talk to me about hip hop or your favorite burger
      place or what you think the meaning of life is and we can be great
      friends. Looking forward to an awesome summer with you guys!!</p>
